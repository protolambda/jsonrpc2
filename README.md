# jsonrpc2

Go types and utils for JSON RPC 2.0.

These bindings are intended to be super minimal,
allowing servers and proxies to route and manage the JSON RPC messages in highly customized ways.
E.g. proxy servers that re-route or adapt messages.

Opinionated JSON RPC error constants for common Ethereum EIPs (EIP-1474, EIP-1193) are included.
